# DriftGuard MVP User Story

## Primary Actor
**DevOps Engineer / SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)** - Operations team member responsible for maintaining infrastructure stability and responding to infrastructure changes in multi-cloud environments.

## User Story Title
"As a DevOps Engineer managing infrastructure drift across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments, I want an AI-powered dashboard that provides real-time drift detection, contextual root cause analysis, and intelligent remediation recommendations so that I can quickly understand why drifts occur and make informed decisions without manually correlating logs, Git history, and incident data."

## Epic Overview
DriftGuard transforms infrastructure drift from a reactive fire-fighting activity into a proactive, intelligent operational workflow that preserves both infrastructure consistency and operational agility.

## Acceptance Criteria - MVP Core Features

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Integration
**Given** infrastructure managed with Terraform, CloudFormation, or Kubernetes manifests
**When** infrastructure state diverges from IaC declarations
**Then** DriftGuard detects changes in real-time with {minimum 95% accuracy} across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments

### AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis
**Given** a detected infrastructure drift event
**When** DriftGuard analyzes cloud audit logs, Git commits, incident tickets, and monitoring metrics using ML models
**Then** the system identifies drift causes (emergency fix, manual troubleshooting, security response, configuration error, automated response) with {minimum 80% precision} and provides confidence scores

### Contextual Correlation Engine
**Given** multi-source operational data streams
**When** DriftGuard correlates temporal patterns, user behaviors, and system states
**Then** users see complete operational narratives explaining "who caused the drift?", "when did it happen?", and "what triggered it?" within the incident timeline

### Intelligent Remediation Recommendations
**Given** classified drift cause and severity impact
**When** ML models evaluate operational context against organizational policies
**Then** the system recommends one of: auto-revert, codify-into-IaC, escalate-for-review, or accept-as-exception with explainable reasoning and risk assessment

### Drift Severity Scoring
**Given** infrastructure changes across security, compliance, performance, and cost dimensions
**When** DriftGuard assesses operational impact
**Then** users see quantified severity metrics (Low/Medium/High) with breakdown of specific violations and recommended action urgency

### Django-Based Modern Dashboard
**Given** multi-cloud infrastructure monitoring
**When** users access the web dashboard
**Then** they see real-time drift visualization with timeline views, correlation heatmaps, recommendation confidence bars, and role-based approval workflows (View/Edit/Admin)

### Gemini AI Agent Integration
**Given** complex drift scenarios with ambiguous operational context
**When** users request AI assistance
**Then** Gemini AI agent provides natural language analysis, remediation reasoning, and contextual Q&A about the detected changes

## MVP Technical Architecture Constraints

### Core Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with Django framework for API and core logic
- **Frontend**: Django templates with Bootstrap/Material Design for responsive dashboard
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing drift events, ML model predictions, and operational data
- **AI/ML**: MLflow for model management, using scikit-learn/XGBoost for classification
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized with Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes
- **Observability**: Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards

### MVP Scope Boundaries - What We Won't Build Initially
- Advanced features: Automated execution of remediation, policy engines, cost optimization
- Scale limitations: Production-grade enterprise integrations, 99.99% SLA
- Tool support: Full ArgoCD/Flux deep integration or PagerDuty/Jira bidirectional workflows

## MVP Success Metrics (Quantifiable Outcomes)
1. **Detection Accuracy**: >95% drift detection rate with <5% false positives
2. **Analysis Time**: Root cause identification within 30 seconds of drift detection
3. **User Efficiency**: 60% reduction in MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) compared to manual analysis
4. **Adoption Rate**: 80% of drifts evaluated using automated recommendations
5. **Operational Impact**: >70% customer satisfaction score for remediation transparency

## Definition of Done
- [ ] MVP deployed in single-cloud environment (AWS staging) with synthetic drift scenarios
- [ ] Core drift detection validated against Terraform/CloudFormation/Kubernetes resources
- [ ] ML model trained on labeled drift patterns with >80% classification accuracy
